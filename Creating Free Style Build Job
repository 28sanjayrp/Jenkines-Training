***************************Creating a Freestyle Build Job******************************


Tools: Git , Git Hub, and Jenkins

Steps to be followed:
1.	Create a GitHub repository 
2.	Add a Java program to the repository
3.	Create a freestyle build job in Jenkins
4.	Build the Java program with Jenkins

Step 1 : Create a GitHub repo
> open the git hub on browser, and sign in to your account.
> click on "+" icon and select "New Repository".
> provider the repository name, select the checkbox of Add a README file , select file type as public and click on create repository.
> click on code, then click on HTTPS and click on copy icon to copy the url.

Step 2 : Add a Java program to the repository
>open the terminal, Run "$mkdir HelloWorld" to create a new directory.
> Run "$git init" to initialize the git in the directory to track the files
> navigate to the HelloWorld directory - $cd HelloWorld
> create a one jave file = $touch HelloWorld.java, and vi the file to open it in text editor - $vi hello-world.java
> write jave code as shown below to print the "Hello World" 
>>>>public class Helloworld{
      public static viod main(String[] args){
              System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
    }  

Note: file name and class name should be same in jave(HelloWorld)
>save the file and exit from the text editor -> press (esc) and type (:wq)

> Run "$git add . or $git add HelloWorld.java" to add the file to staging area
> Run "$git commit Helloworld.java -m "New File Added" to commit the changes to the local repo.

> Run "$git remote add origin <copied url from github>"  to establish the connection between local repo and github.
> Run "$git push -u origin master" to push the local changes to the remote(github) directory.


step 3 : Create a freestyle build job in Jenkins
> Go to your jenkin's dashboard, click on "New Item" enter a name for your project or job or task in the "Enter an item name field" 
example- "Freestyle project demo"
> select "Freestyle Project" as the build job type, click on ok.
*>> Go to the "Source code management section" and select 'Git'(redio btn)
*>> paste the copied url from github after pushing the .java file
> click on save.

step 4 : Build the Java program with Jenkins
> click on the created jenkins project name in the jenkins dashboard.
> click on "Build Now" in the project window, jenkins will now build your project.
> click on "Build History" to view the build result.
> click on the "console output" to view the build logs.
